#1. ui folder:
Will contain reusable UI components (like: buttons, inputs...).
Mostly they are just presentational and don't contain side effects.

#2. services folder:     
This folder is for reusable code for interacting with API.

#3. utils folder: 
These are helper functions that we can also reuse in multiple places of the application.
Reusable and stateless helper functions that don't create any side effects (like: date or number manipulations...).

#4 A whole new way of Routing:
This is the recommended router for all React Router web projects to work with powerful APIs like Data Loader, Data Actions or Data Fetchers.

Example: App.jsx

#5. Architecture of App Layout:
So, the Header and Footer would stay the same across the whole application, only Main will change according to pages (like: Cart, Menu or Order...).

#6. Nested Routes:
The AppLayout.jsx is a 'parent Route' of all routes, inside it we have <Outlet /> which is the placeholder for 'child routes'. The 'child routes' are in the 'children' property of the 'router'. Now they are nested routes.

<AppLayout /> - since it doesn't have a 'path', it is technically called 'Layout Route'.

Example: App.jsx file
